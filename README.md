# Heart_disease_pridiction usinf KNN
Heart disease prediction using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a machine learning approach that helps assess the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Understanding KNN for Heart Disease Prediction:
    1.1 KNN is a lazy learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on its nearest neighbors.
    1.2 It works by calculating the distance between a new data point and existing labeled data points, then assigns the 
       most common label among the nearest neighbors.

2. Dataset Overview:
   2.1 The dataset typically includes features like:
       Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol), Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), 
       Maximum Heart Rate (thalach), Exercise-Induced Angina (exang), and more.

   2.2 The target variable is binary (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence).

3. Data Preprocessing:
   3.1 Handling Missing Values: Replace missing entries with the mean value of each column.
   3.2 Feature Scaling: Standardization using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to distance 
       computations.
   3.3 Data Splitting: Typically, 67% for training and 33% for testing to evaluate performance.

4. Model Training:
   4.1 Set n_neighbors=5 (meaning it checks 5 nearest neighbors for classification).
   4.2 Use Euclidean distance to measure similarity between data points.

5. Model Evaluation:
   5.1 Accuracy Score: Measures correct predictions.
   5.2 Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score.
   5.3 Confusion Matrix: Helps visualize true positives, false positives, and false negatives.

6. Optimization & Future Enhancements:
   6.1 Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to find the best k value.
   6.2 ROC Curve & AUC Score: Evaluate model performance.
   6.3 Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key predictors like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and exercise- 
       induced angina.
