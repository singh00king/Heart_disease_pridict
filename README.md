Heart disease prediction using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a machine 
learning approach that helps assess the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. 
Here's a breakdown of how it works: 
1. Understanding KNN for Heart Disease Prediction 
 KNN is a lazy learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on its nearest 
neighbors. 
 It works by calculating the distance between a new data point and existing labeled 
data points, then assigns the most common label among the nearest neighbors. 
2. Dataset Overview 
 The dataset typically includes features like: 
o Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), 
Cholesterol (chol), Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs), Maximum Heart Rate 
(thalach), Exercise-Induced Angina (exang), and more. 
 The target variable is binary (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence). 
3. Data Preprocessing 
 Handling Missing Values: Replace missing entries with the mean value of each 
column. 
 Feature Scaling: Standardization using StandardScaler to ensure all features 
contribute equally to distance computations. 
 Data Splitting: Typically, 67% for training and 33% for testing to evaluate 
performance. 
4. Model Training 
 Set n_neighbors=5 (meaning it checks 5 nearest neighbors for classification). 
 Use Euclidean distance to measure similarity between data points. 
5. Model Evaluation 
 Accuracy Score: Measures correct predictions. 
 Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score. 
 Confusion Matrix: Helps visualize true positives, false positives, and false negatives. 
6. Optimization & Future Enhancements 
 Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to find the best k value. 
 ROC Curve & AUC Score: Evaluate model performance. 
 Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key predictors like chest pain type, 
maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina.
